Connect Four
The Vertical Board Game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four

Instead of the typical horizontally flat board like chess, a connect four board stand vertically counting six high and seven across. After a player drops their colored stone, the force due to gravity
accerlates the stone downward. Then the opponent drops a stone in any of the seven columns. After a column is filled with six stones, a player may not place a stone in that column. Each column can be played six times.

I have over 300 wins on the iMessage version of Connect Four. I would say I am a skilled player, but Connect Four is a solved game. The person who plays first can win every time. 
There is a computer on a website that cannot lose if it plays first. I do not have the moves memorized because that would ruin the game. 

In this repo, I create a simple interface where two people can play with mechanism to end the game upon a player winning. I would like to try to classify the outcomes before I explore more sophisticated methods
to solve the game.
